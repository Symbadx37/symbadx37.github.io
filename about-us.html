            <h1 class="large-heading">About Us</h1>
            <p>Here at Quinton's Burgers & Fries, pleasing customers is our last priority. We take pride in the fact that
               we don't go a single day without receiving customer complaints about our business. Consistency is key after all,
               and here at Quinton's, customer orders are consistently wrong, every single time.</p>
            <h1 class="large-heading">Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission here at Quinton's Burgers & Fries is simple. Make money. Make money on top of money on top of
               even more money. Make so much money that billionaires  such as Jeff Bezos  or Bill Gates look like peasants compared to
               our corporation. After all, money can buy happiness! Oh wait, that's not how it goes . . . Well, besides making 
               gargantuan amounts of money by ripping off our own customers (like every other corporation in this nation), our secondary 
               mission here at Quinton's Burgers & Fries is solving world hunger and poverty, by literally causing it. How? Simple. Get people
               addicted to your food products (that are totally good for your health, just ask our CEO), then convince them that they can't live
               without them. That way, if an entire town is addicted to your products, and you go out of business, the entire town will starve to death!
               Oh wait, that's a bit morbid . . . Uh how about you forget you even read this paragraph, and instead visit our restaurant instead!</p>

                have anything to worry about!"</p>
