        <h1 class="large-heading">Entrees</h1>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Single Hamburger</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $25.99 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> An ordinary, single patty hamburger. What's not to love? Well, if you ignore the fact that it doesn't 
            even have beef in it. Or ham. Or anything that could be considered actual 'meat'. We don't know if anyone at our 
            <del>laboratory</del> kitchen even knows what's in this burger. Ah well, it's not like it matters, you'll order it anyway 
            . . . right?</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Double Hamburger</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $54.99 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> Identical to the single hamburger, except you get a smaller amount of food for a higher cost than
            if you ordered two single hamburgers. Clever, right? This product also has the same problems as it's predecessor (genetics,
             are we right?), with you know, not actually being a hamburger and everything.</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Cheeseburger</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $42.49 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> Literally just a single hamburger but with a slice of cheese on top, only for the additional cost of 
            $16.50 (convenience is expensive). We're not even sure if the cheese is actually cheese. We're not even sure if it 
            <i>tastes</i> like cheese. Actually, we're not even sure if we can legally <i>call</i> it cheese. Oh well, that's a problem for 
            another decade, we've got money to make here!</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Fat Mac</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $89.99 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> This is our award-stealing signature product, for all the wrong reasons. Not only is it outrageously expensive 
            for absolutely no reason, but it also tastes absolutely awful according to both our critics and customers. If you think you're brave 
            enough, give it a shot, just make sure to sign our legal waiver first before chowing down.</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Fish Sandwich</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $34.49 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> A worthy alternative to our burgers (or not). All of our fish products are raised in plastic kiddie pools, 
            which are always overcrowded and unsanitary (it's literally off the charts). And no, we don't have any form of sauces or condiments, so don't even bother asking.</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Chicken Sandwich</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $28.99 each</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> We were legally blackmailed by our board executives to add this food item to our menu, for all those people who show up 
            to a <i>burger</i> restaurant and then order a <i>chicken</i> based product. It's borderline insanity. And that's saying something, 
            especially coming from us.</p>

    <section class="main-content-area">
        <h1 class="large-heading">Sides</h1>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Potato Fires</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $8.49 for small, $12.99 for medium, $0.49 for large</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> Typical potato fries, except it's the <i>whole</i> potato. The soil and plant matter is also included to add a bit 
            of extra tang and pungency. If you aren't a fan of unwashed, whole potatoes, then you should try our rotten version 
            (recently discontinued due to health violations).</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Avocado Fries</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $9.49 for small, $15.99 for medium, $0.99 for large</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> Fries, but instead of being made from <i>whole</i> potatoes, they're made from <i>whole</i> avocadoes instead. 
            Not only are they smaller and taste considerably worse, they're also more expensive. Why? We don't know. </p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Tater Tots</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $1.49 for two, $31.99 for three</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u>  If you don't like fries made from whole potatoes or avocadoes, our Tater Tots are just for you! We promise they're 
            just like the ones your grandma used to make, besides you know, the price. Or the quality. Or the taste. Or the grease residue. 
            Beggars can't be choosers, after all!</p>
        <h1 class="large-heading">Drinks</h1>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Lemon Juice</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $0.99 per glass</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> Lemon juice, expect it's literally just lemon juice. What? Did you expect something more sophisticated? If so, 
            you're at the wrong place Jack. Seeds and pulp included. Fun fact: this is our healthiest item on the menu 
            (hmm, we wonder why . . .)</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Cold Chocolate</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $2.99 per glass</p>
        <p><u>Description:</u> What's better than hot chocolate? Definitely not this, but hey, at least it's cheaper than most of the items 
            on our menu! This product is identical to the hot chocolate you would get down the road, the only difference is that we can't be 
            bothered to heat up the chocolate; that would be too much work for our employees (pressing buttons is a lot of work). So we 
            just serve it cold, right out of the packet we bought from our local Walmart. Give it a try sometime
            (or don't, your funeral).</p>
        <h1 class="small-heading">Whipped Cream</h1>
        <p><u>Price:</u> $7.49 per cup</p> 
        <p><u>Description:</u> It's just what it sounds like. 16 ounces of whipped cream, but in a plastic shake container. It doesn't 
            get any simpler (or worse) than this.</p>
